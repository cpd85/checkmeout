# Check Me Out!
Mobile webapp for clever check splitting. Made at HackMIT Fall 2013.

## Description
**Check Me Out!** is a mobile webapp designed for check splitting. Instead of inputting each item one by one, 
the user can simply take a picture of their check. The app uses the open source 
[Tesseract OCR engine](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/) to read the receipt, performs a lot of string
manipulation to parse the raw text output, and then integrates with the Venmo API to allow users to bill friends with
exactly their portion of the check.
